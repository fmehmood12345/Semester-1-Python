### <u> *My experience* </u>
I enjoyed learning about argument parsing as I passed my arguments into parameters in the panda.py file. From this I called my parameters and wrote code which will change my panda respectively. I have never done this before, so I understood that this method of programming will make my code more efficient. This is because my arguments and their characteristics are in a separate file to my main code rather than having all parts of my code in the same file. Overall I believe made my project was made more user-friendly as I ran my argument parsing from the terminal and so the end user decides how the panda changes rather than all changes taking place at once. I enjoyed learning how to code from terminal. This is very efficient when running smaller projects which I believe will help me in the long run on an industry level. 
### <u> *Things I would change* </u>
Something I wanted to include was changing pandas speed whilst it's standing in one spot. However, I was unable to make this happen despite the help of demonstrators. I used skills learned in lectures such as debugging to find the root of the problem. Through this, I found that my *speed* argument from my cli file was working in the panda file. Therefore, I concluded that there was an issue with the code in my panda file. Not having any luck solving the issue, I decided it is best I finish off other requirements of the project and come back to changing the speed of my panda if I have time. Despite the struggle, I enjoyed the experience as it gave me a real-life example of what it’s like being a software developer. I used many resources to solve this issue such as the panda3D documentation, YouTube videos and O’Reilly however due to the lack of time, I was not able to solve this issue.

### <u> *Conclusion* </u>
I also appreciated using industry level tools to program such as GitHub as I am more familiar with it now and thus, I won’t have difficulty when doing group projects with my colleagues in the future. This is because through the use of GitHub, I can trace back over all commits and pushes made and detect which commit resulted in an error. It allowed me to understand the importance of GitHub in a group environment. Overall, I learned a lot from this project, and I am looking forward to broadening my understanding and skills by doing more projects.
